# üéì University Dropout Risk Analytics Platform

This Streamlit application provides a robust, role-based dashboard for university staff (Admins, Principals, HODs, and Mentors) to monitor student performance, predict dropout risk using a machine learning model, and facilitate timely intervention.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Role-Based Access**: Secure login for Admin, Principal, HOD, and Mentor roles, with tailored views and permissions.  
- **Dropout Prediction**: Utilizes a pre-trained Scikit-learn model (`dropout_prediction_model_final.pkl`) to calculate weekly dropout probability and assign risk levels (High, Moderate, Low).  
- **Weekly Data Upload (Admin Only)**: Admins can upload weekly student data (Attendance, Assessments, Fees) via CSV files.  
- **Real-time Alerts**: Admins can trigger background email notifications to Mentors for students flagged as High Risk.  
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive Plotly charts for performance trends, risk distribution, and departmental comparisons.  
- **Mentor Intervention**: Mentors can add descriptive notes for high-risk students to track intervention efforts.  
- **MongoDB Integration**: Uses MongoDB to store persistent data (mentor profiles, student masters, and weekly processed data).

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

To run this application, you must have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **MongoDB Server**: Running locally (default connection string `mongodb://localhost:27017/`).  
- **Required Python Libraries** (listed below).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install all necessary Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly pymongo joblib
```
### 2. File Structure

university-dashboard-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py # Main Streamlit application script  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dropout_prediction_model_final.pkl # Pre-trained ML model  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mentors.csv # Initial data for user authentication  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ student_master.csv # Static student information

### 3. MongoDB Configuration

The application connects to a local MongoDB instance.

1. Start your MongoDB server.  
2. On the first run, the app will automatically:
   - Create the database `university_dashboard`
   - Initialize the collections `mentors_data` and `student_master_data` if they are empty  
     using the local CSV files.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Ensure `mentors.csv` contains the correct user IDs, roles, and departments to match the application's logic (e.g., `ADM-`, `PRN-`, `HOD-` prefixes).

### 4. Email Alert Setup

To enable email notifications:

1. Go to your **Google Account Security settings**.  
2. Navigate to **How you sign in to Google ‚Üí App passwords**.  
3. Generate a new password for the **Mail** app on your computer.  
4. Update `app.py` with the generated password:

```python
APP_PASSWORD = "reln tijr nsol ezds"  # <- REPLACE THIS
```
